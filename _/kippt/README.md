A beautiful way to display your Kippt lists. See mine [here](http://reading.syropia.net).

## Setup

Simply edit `kippt.php` and add your username, API token (which can be retrieved from the [Kippt Developer Page](http://developers.kippt.com)), and the id of the list you want to pull from. You may also modify the `$limit` variable to change how many clips are retrieved.

**Note:** If you don't know the numerical ID of the list, the slug should work fine as well.
